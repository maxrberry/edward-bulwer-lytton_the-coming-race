                    <p>The animal here referred to has many points of difference from the tiger of the upper world. It is larger, and with a broader paw, and still more receding frontal. It haunts the side of lakes and pools, and feeds principally on fishes, though it does not object to any terrestrial animal of inferior strength that comes in its way. It is becoming very scarce even in the wild districts, where it is devoured by gigantic reptiles. I apprehended that it clearly belongs to the tiger species, since the parasite animalcule found in its paw, like that in the Asiatic tiger, is a miniature image of itself.</p>

                    <p>I once tried the effect of the <i xml:lang="x-vril">vril</i> bath. It was very similar in its invigorating powers to that of the baths at Gastein, the virtues of which are ascribed by many physicians to electricity; but though similar, the effect of the <i xml:lang="x-vril">vril</i> bath was more lasting.</p>

                    <p>For the sake of convenience, I adopt the word hours, days, years, <abbr>etc.</abbr>, in any general reference to subdivisions of time among the Vril-ya; those terms but loosely corresponding, however, with such subdivisions.</p>

                    <p>This may remind the student of Nero’s invention of a musical machine, by which water was made to perform the part of an orchestra, and on which he was employed when the conspiracy against him broke out.</p>

                    <p>I never had observed it; and, if I had, am not physiologist enough to have distinguished the difference.</p>

                    <p>Literally “has said, In this house be it requested.” Words synonymous with law, as implying forcible obligation, are avoided by this singular people. Even had it been decreed by the Tur that his College of Sages should dissect me, the decree would have ran blandly thus⁠—“Be it requested that, for the good of the community, the carnivorous Tish be requested to submit himself to dissection.”</p>
